        <p>Foxes are small to medium-sized mammals with bushy tails, pointed ears, and long fur. They are part of the dog family (Canidae) and live on every continent except Antarctica. The most well-known fox is the red fox, but there are several other species of fox, including the gray fox, Arctic fox, and bat-eared fox
